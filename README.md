**Usage**
You can use this server as a starting point for building your own application. It provides a basic setup for handling HTTP requests and includes a dummy array to simulate data retrieval from a database.

The server includes an example route handler for fetching meter reading data based on an id parameter. It returns a JSON response with the dummy data and a message indicating the ID.

To customize the server and add your own routes or data retrieval logic, you can modify the server.js file located in the project root directory.

Enjoy!
